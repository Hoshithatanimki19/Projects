Problem statement
The problem statement chosen for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle Website website and it has a total of 5,68,629 transactions. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, so it needs to be handled before model building.
